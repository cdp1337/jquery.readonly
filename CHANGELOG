Version 2.0.1
Released - 2011.10.20
Minor fix in the logic, setting elements as "disabled='disabled'" will cause 
them to be ignored by forms.  This was NOT the intended behaviour.

=============

Version 2.0.0
Released - 2011.09.27
Completely rewritten for jQuery 1.6 +
Should be much more efficient, (and closer matching to jQuery's plugin development standards).
Now includes an auto z-index, where the div overlay will be 1-larger than the constrained element.
Includes more accurate targetting for nested elements, (ie: readonly() on a div/form containing elements, every element is constrained now).

Testing Report:
   Well, it works in Firefox 6.0.2...

=============

Version 1.0-beta1
Released - 2009.12.18

Completely rewrote plugin again, (this seems to be a reoccuring pattern, eh?!)
	Global object is still in place, but now contains any default settigns for the
	plugin; as well as what it handled previously.
In addition to the global object, a new object, (com_powelltechs_readonly), is 
	attached directly to each element that is readonly'ified.  This object contains
	a copy of the default settings, allowing each element to be customized.


Testing Report:
	Tests ran: Every example under the Examples link. 
	(http://dev.powelltechs.com/jquery.readonly/examples)
	
	* Testing Overview:
	** Browser w/v **  OS w/v    ** Status **
	  Firefox 3.5.6    Ubuntu 9.04  Good
	  Opera            ---          ---
	  Chrome 2.0       WinXP        Bugs Detected
	  IE 8.0           WinXP        Bugs Detected
	  IE 7.0           WinXP        Good
	  IE 6.0           Win2000      Good
	  Konqueror        ---          ---
	  Safari           ---          ---
	
	* Testing Details:
	IE6 seems to have some strange items, (big surprise there...)
	IE7 runs good.
	IE8 - Bug with onKeyDown event, not being registered... hmm
	Chrome - Bug with onKeyDown event, not being registered... at least it's not only IE...
	

Future Notes:
	Get bugzilla to play nicely...
	I still need to get an automated javascript testing interface put inplace for
	 	automated tests of this plugin.

Known Bugs:
	IE6 and IE8 seem to have an extra onFocus/tab event that gets attached.  A suspicion 
		of this is the "this.elementBound.attr('tabindex', '0');" line.  This will set
		any element to have a specific tab order, enabling the onFocus event.  This 
		should be reworked to remember the last tabIndex of the object, then set it 
		to that upon unsetting the overlay.  This is affecting the tab and click behaviour.
	IE6 selectbox hack can behave better.  The current hack is to hide the select
		box completely, as IE6 renders that as a different above-page element.
	When the text size is changed on any browser **EXCEPT** for Opera, the overlay loses sync
		from the element it's covering.  This only seems to be an issue when the browser's Zoom
		feature is used.

=============

Version 0.7
Released - 2009.06.17

Completely rewrote the plugin, utilizing a static global object to handle the overlays.
  This provides an internal index of the currently readonly objects
  and a central point of access for the various methods used.
Should have fixed any bugs related to the window resizing, throwing off the positioning.
  This is done by an interval timer that ticks every 1/2 second.  The ticking function
  checks the last known positions of any 'bound' element and, if changed, updates the
  overlay to stay overtop of the element.

Testing Report:
 ** Browser w/v **  OS w/v    ** Status **
 * Firefox 3.0.8    Ubuntu 9.04  Good
 * Firefox 3.x      Win2000      Good
 * Opera 9.64       WinXP        OK - Bug where focus function is not attaching.
 * Chrome 2.0       WinXP        Good
 * IE 8.0           WinXP        Good
 * IE 7.0           WinXP        Good
 * IE 6.0           Win2000      Good (as good as ie6 on win2000 can be...)
 * Konqueror 4.2.2  Ubuntu 9.04  Good (surprisingly...)
 * Safari 4.30.17   WinXP        Good

Future Notes:
  None

Known Bugs:
  On Opera 9.x winXP, the focus event that is designed to automatically blur does not fire.
   This allows the user to select the 'readonly' elements and chagne them via tabbing.
   This only seems to affect Opera however.
  When the text size is changed on any browser **EXCEPT** for Opera, the overlay loses sync
   from the element it's covering.  This only seems to be an issue when the browser's Zoom
   feature is used.

=============

Version 0.6.2
Released - 2009.04.16
Fixed compability with IE6.
  Including an error where parseInt returns NaN, throwing off the width/height calculations.
  Including the ever-annoying SELECT element issue of it remaining on top of any element.

=============

Version 0.6.1
Released - 2009.04.09
Addition to 0 padding and margin in CSS to overwrite any other styling set.  This resulted in the grey overlapping over the element.
Changed all requests for '$' to jQuery, the proper method for plugins.

=============

Version 0.6
Released 2009.04.03
Initial release of this plugin
