Demo (todo)
This plugin simply makes virtually any element on a page "readonly". This includes input boxes, select boxes, radio options, anchors, paragraphs, divs, iframes, even the entire page. I originally developed it for a select box since some browsers (IE), don't support readonly as a valid attribute on them.
